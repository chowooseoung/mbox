# mbox

mbox started with the aim of studying mgear. Therefore, most core functions come from mgear. mgear is the best rigging framework. But mgear's inheritance was a bit complicated for me. So I modified it in a way that I think was easier. My programming level is still low, so things I've changed may have gone in the wrong direction.
